# Personal Knowledge Copilot

A multi-agent system that helps you organize, retrieve, and understand your personal knowledge base. Built with RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology and a collaborative agent architecture to provide insightful answers from your documents.

## Project Overview

Personal Knowledge Copilot transforms how you interact with your document collection. Upload documents once, then ask questions in natural language to get accurate answers based on your content. Multiple specialized AI agents work together to understand your question, research your documents, and deliver comprehensive responses.

## Features (Planned)

- üìÑ **Document Processing**: Upload and process various document types (text, PDF, Markdown)
- üîç **Semantic Search**: Find information based on meaning, not just keywords
- ü§ñ **Multi-Agent System**: Specialized agents for query understanding, research, and organization
- üìä **Knowledge Visualization**: Explore connections between concepts in your documents
- üß† **Memory & Context**: Maintains conversation history for contextual interactions

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React 19, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: FastAPI, LangChain
- **Vector Database**: ChromaDB
- **Embeddings**: sentence-transformers
- **LLM Integration**: Ollama for local LLM support

## Project Status

This project is currently in early development. Development roadmap:

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- Basic document processing pipeline
- Simple retrieval and question answering
- Core API endpoints

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent System
- Specialized agent development
- Agent orchestration
- Enhanced response generation

### Phase 3: Interface & Visualization
- Improved user interface
- Knowledge graph visualization
- Advanced search capabilities

### Phase 4: Extended Features
- Memory systems for agents
- Custom agent creation
- Integration capabilities

## Quick Start (Coming Soon)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personal-knowledge-copilot.git
cd personal-knowledge-copilot

# Start with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

## Development Setup

Instructions for setting up the development environment will be provided as the project develops. The project uses:

- Python 3.10+ for the backend
- Node.js 18+ for the frontend
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

## Motivation

This project was created to explore the practical applications of multi-agent systems combined with RAG technology. While many knowledge management tools exist, few leverage the collaborative power of specialized AI agents working together on your personal document collection.

Personal Knowledge Copilot aims to create a more intelligent interface to your information, helping you discover connections and insights that might otherwise remain hidden in your documents.
